in django:
    there may be multiple apps in a project 
    and also one app may be in multiple projects

    App is a plugable web application 

    To create an app in project we can run the command 
        python manage.py startapp app_name

        Now to add the urls of app_name in your project you can
            from django.urls import path, include 
            urlpatterns = [
                path('url_path/', include('app_name.urls'))
            ]

            and Now in your app_name create a urls.py file and create the urlpatterns list there and include the url there

        Now to add the template in the app:
            go to the settings.py of your project and then in the 'INSTALLED_APPS' list append your app_name
            and then in your app create a templates folder

        To add the static file in the app:
            create a static folder
            go to the template and load the static file by: 
                {% load static %}
                and then print the value of static file by:
                    {% static 'shop/mystatic.txt' %}
