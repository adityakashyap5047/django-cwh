in django:
    there may be multiple apps in a project 
    and also one app may be in multiple projects

    App is a plugable web application 

    To create an app in project we can run the command 
        python manage.py startapp app_name

        Now to add the urls of app_name in your project you can
            from django.urls import path, include 
            urlpatterns = [
                path('url_path/', include('app_name.urls'))
            ]

            and Now in your app_name create a urls.py file and create the urlpatterns list there and include the url there
