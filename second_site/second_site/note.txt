in django:
    there may be multiple apps in a project 
    and also one app may be in multiple projects

    App is a plugable web application 

    To create an app in project we can run the command 
        python manage.py startapp app_name

        Now to add the urls of app_name in your project you can
            from django.urls import path, include 
            urlpatterns = [
                path('url_path/', include('app_name.urls'))
            ]

            and Now in your app_name create a urls.py file and create the urlpatterns list there and include the url there

        Now to add the template in the app:
            go to the settings.py of your project and then in the 'INSTALLED_APPS' list append your app_name
            and then in your app create a templates folder

        To add the static file in the app:
            create a static folder
            go to the template and load the static file by: 
                {% load static %}
                and then print the value of static file by:
                    {% static 'shop/mystatic.txt' %}

        
Models -> A model is the single, definite source of information about your data.
            It contains the essential fields and behabiors of the data you are storing.
            Generally, each model maps to a single database table.

    
    django default stores the data in the sqlite3 database

    sqlite is a RDBMS that stores the data in the files.

    To apply all the migration in our project we run the command:
        python manage.py migrate
    
    migrate -> It applies all pending database migrations.
 
        i.e. it ensures that the necessary tables and schema changes are created as defined in the project's migration files. 

        This process synchronizes the database structure with the models defined in the application.

        migration - In simple words migration means the changes which we do in model we store that
            if we create migration then we doesn't change the database instead of we only store the information that we are only doing this changes and this changes will to come

            and if we apply those migration then we do the change in the database
